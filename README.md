# What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides:

Efficient multi-dimensional arrays (ndarray)

Mathematical functions to operate on arrays

Tools for integrating with C/C++ and Fortran code

Support for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation
# Core Features of NumPy
   1. Creating Arrays
       import numpy as np

   a = np.array([1, 2, 3])           # 1D array
   b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])    # 2D array
